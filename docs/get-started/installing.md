# Installing
Currently, the only way to try Strata is by compiling it using the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) compiler.

## Installing Rust
To build Strata, you need the Rust compiler and Cargo. These maybe available as specific packages in your distro's repository. For instructions to install these on some common distros, see below. If your distro is not listed, you can try the alternative method give afterwards.

::: code-group

```bash [Arch Linux]
sudo pacman -S rust
